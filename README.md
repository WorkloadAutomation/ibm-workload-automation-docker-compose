## Getting Started

If you want to start the containers via Docker Compose, use the following command to clone the current repository:

    git clone https://github.com/WorkloadAutomation/ibm-workload-automation-docker-compose.git

If you don't have git installed in your environment, download the ZIP file from the main page of the repository:

    Click on "Code" and select "Download ZIP"

If you want customize the installation parameters, modify the **docker-compose.yml** file.

Accept the product licenses by setting the **LICENSE** parameter to **"accept"** in the **wa.env** file located in the container package as follows: **LICENSE=accept**

In the directory where  the **docker-compose.yml** file has been located, you can start the containers by running the following command:

    docker-compose up -d

Once the command has been launched, be sure that the containers are started using the following command:

    docker ps 

You can optionally check the container logs using the following command:

    docker-compose logs -f <container_name>

Where container_name can be: wa-server, wa-console or wa-agent.

## Supported Docker versions

Support for older versions (down to 1.11.0) is provided on a best-effort basis.

Please see the [Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon. 

## Limitations
The owner of all product files is the wauser user, thus the product doesn't run as root, but as wauser only. Don't perform the login as root to start processes or execute other commands such as Jnextplan, otherwise it might create some issues.

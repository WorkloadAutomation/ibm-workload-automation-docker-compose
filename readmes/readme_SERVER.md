# Workload Automation Server

## Introduction
Workload Automation is a complete, modern solution for batch and real-time workload management. It enables organizations to gain complete visibility and control over attended or unattended workloads. 

From a single point of control, it supports multiple platforms and provides advanced integration with enterprise applications including ERP, Business Analytics, File Transfer, Big Data, and Cloud applications. See [Installing Automation Hub integrations](#installing-automation-hub-integrations) for more information about integrating third-party plug-ins and integrations.

Docker adoption ensures standardization of your workload scheduling environment and provides an easy method to replicate environments quickly in development, build, test, and production environments, speeding up the time it takes to get from build to production significantly. Install your environment using Docker to improve scalability, portability, and efficiency.

## Accessing the container images

### From the Entitled Registry
You can access the Server container image from the Entitled Registry:

1. Access the entitled registry. Log in to [MyIBM Container Software Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) with the IBMid and password that are associated with the entitled software.


2.  In the **Container software library** tile, click **View library** and then click **Copy key** to copy the entitlement key to the clipboard.

3.  Run the following command to login into the IBM Entitled Registry:
      
        docker login -u cp -p <your_entitled_key> cp.icr.io
	

 The image is as follows:

* cp.icr.io/cp/ibm-workload-automation-server:10.1.0.00.20220722


### From IBM Fix Central

If you are accessing the images from IBM Fix Central, use the following command to upload the image to your local Docker environment:

     docker load -i <tar_name>
	 
  where <tar_name> is the name of the .tar file containing the image.





Before you deploy IBM Workload Automation components on Linux on Z, see  [Deploying Docker compose on Linux on Z](https://www.ibm.com/docs/workload-scheduler/10.1.0?topic=SSGSPN_10.1.0/compose-deploying-docker-linux-z)


## Getting Started
You can deploy the IBM Workload Automation containers using either Docker compose or Docker run. For both of these methods, ensure you download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com). 

### Getting started with Docker compose

Download and install [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). We recommend version 1.27 or later to take advantage of named volumes.

To start the container via Docker Compose, run the following command to clone the current repository:



         git clone https://github.com/WorkloadAutomation/ibm-workload-automation-docker-compose.git



If you do not have GitHub installed in your environment, download the ZIP file from the main page of the repository:

    Click on "Code" and select "Download ZIP"

If you want customize the installation parameters, modify the **docker-compose.yml** file.

Accept the product licenses by setting the **LICENSE** parameter to **"accept"** in the **wa.env** file located in the container package as follows: **LICENSE=accept**

In the directory where  the **docker-compose.yml** file has been located, you can start the containers by running the following command:

    docker-compose up -d wa-server wa-db2

Once the command has been launched, be sure that the containers are started using the following command:

    docker ps 

You can optionally check the container logs using the following commands:

    docker-compose logs -f wa-server
     OR
    docker-compose logs -f wa-db2


### Getting Started with Docker run

The IBM Workload Automation container has the following prerequisites:

 - Create a DB instance and schema

   For example, use the following command to create a DB2 instance and schema:   

       docker run --rm ibm-workload-automation-server:10.1.0.00 cat /opt/wa/TWS/tws_tools/create_database.sql >create_database.sql
       
   Copy the "create_database.sql" file on the workstation where the DB2 has been installed, perform a login as administrator and run the following command:
 
       db2 -tvf create_database.sql 
       
To start the container from the command-line, launch the following command by adding the name of the image that has been loaded:

	 docker run \
		-d -e PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=server_host_name \
		-e PUBLIC_PORT=server_port \
		-e LICENSE=ACCEPT \
		-e WA_PASSWORD=wa_password \
		-e DB_TYPE=db_type \
		-e DB_HOSTNAME=db_hostname \
		-e DB_PORT=db port \
		-e DB_NAME=db_name \
		-e DB_USER=db_user \
		-e DB_PASSWORD=db_password \
		-e DB_ADMIN_USER=db_admin_user \
		-e DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=db_admin_password \
			-v workload-automation-server-data:/home/wauser \
		ibm-workload-automation-server:10.1.0.00.\<release_date>

> **Note:** The name of the image has to be the same as the one you loaded on your local workstation when you launched the docker load command.


### Installing with custom .PEM certificates
To use custom certificates, modify the volume `<path_on_host_containing_certs>:/opt/wautils/certs` with the path of the directory that contains your certificates at the place of `<path_on_host_containing_certs>`. In the defined folder, add the following certificates:

      - ca.crt
      - tls.key
      - tls.crt
### Additional configuration
The following information applies to both deploying with Docker compose and Docker run.

> **Note**: Internal ports are predefined and must not be changed. External ports can be customized.

If your server component uses a timezone different from the default timezone, then to avoid problems with the FINAL job stream, you must update MAKEPLAN within the DOCOMMAND, specifying the timezone parameter and value. For example, if you are using the America/Los Angeles timezone, then it must be specified as follows:

    WA_WA-SERVER_XA#MAKEPLAN
    DOCOMMAND "TODAY_DATE=`${UNISONHOME}/bin/datecalc today pic YYYYMMDD`; ${UNISONHOME}/MakePlan -to `${UNISONHOME}/bin/datecalc ${TODAY_DATE}070
    0 + 1 day + 2 hours pic MM/DD/YYYY^HHTT` timezone America/Los_Angeles"
    STREAMLOGON wauser

## Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration

To enable SSO between console and server, LTPA tokens must be the same. The following procedure explains how to create LTPA tokens to be shared between server and console (this procedure must be run only once and not on both systems). 

To create new LTPA token, launch the following command:

     docker run -i --rm -v <host_dir>:/output ibm-workload-automation-server:10.1.0.00 /opt/wautils/wa_create_ltpa_keys.sh -p <keys_password>

  where:
  - **<host_dir>** is an existing folder on the local machine where docker runs
  - **<keys_password>** is LTPA keys password ( for further details, see the [online](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGSPN_10.1.0/com.ibm.tivoli.itws.doc_9.5/distr/src_ad/awsadshareltpa.htm) documentation).
	
The "ltpa.keys" and "wa_ltpa.xml" files are created in the local folder \<hostdir>.

The "ltpa.keys" file must be placed into the volume that stores customized SSL certificates (on both server and console charts).

In both server and console charts, useCustomizedCert property must be set on "true".

The "wa_ltpa.xml" file must be placed in the volume that stores all custom liberty configuration (on both server and console charts).
	
## Report CLI 	

To run reports in batch mode, perform the following steps:

1. Browse to `/home/wauser/wadata/config/report`
2. Open the **common.properties** file in a flat-text editor.
3. Edit the file inserting the information for your database. Instructions on editing the file are provided in the file itself. 

The Report CLI is now ready for running. To start the Report CLI, browse to `/opt/wa/report` and run the following command: `./reportcli.sh`

Consider the following example:

`./reportcli.sh -p reports/templates/jrh.properties -r my_report -commonPropsFile /home/wauser/wadata/config/report`

## Installing Automation Hub integrations  

You can extend Workload Automation with a number of out-of-the-box integrations, or plug-ins. Complete documentation for the integrations is available on [Automation Hub](https://www.yourautomationhub.io/). For information about the procedure to deploy the integrations, browse to the Info tab for the integration of your choice and 
scroll down to the Deploying an integration section.

You can also extend Workload Automation with custom plug-ins or integrations that you create. For information about creating a custom plug-in and deploying the plug-in see [Workload Automation Lutist Development Kit](https://www.yourautomationhub.io/toolkit) on Automation Hub.

## Metrics Monitoring

Workload Automation exposes a number of metrics to provide you with insight into the state, health, and performance of your environment and infrastructure. You can access the product APIs for monitoring and retrieving insightful metrics data. The metrics are exposed and can be visualized with tools for displaying application metrics such as, the open source tool Grafana. If you use Grafana, you can take advantage of the preconfigured dashboard that is available with the deployment of the Dynamic Workload Console and the server  components. For more information about the metrics available, see [Metrics monitoring](https://www.ibm.com/docs/workload-scheduler/10.1.0?topic=reference-monitoring-prometheus). In a Docker environment, by default, access to the metrics does not require authentication. However, if you want to specify a different user that can access the metrics securely using credentials, modify the prometheus.xml file that you will find automatically created in a Docker environment, adding the additional users.



## Supported Docker versions
This image is officially supported on Docker version 19.xx.xx, or later.

Support for versions earlier than 19.xx.xx, is provided on a best-effort basis.

See the [Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.  


  

## Limitations
The owner of all product files is the wauser user, thus the product does not run as root, but as wauser only. Do not perform the login as root to start processes or run other commands such as Jnextplan, otherwise it might create some issues.

On amd64 and Linux on Z platforms.

## Troubleshooting

If you switch the event processor and move it to a workstation different from the workstation where the dynamic domain manager resides, dynamic agents still point to the previous workstation and fail to contact the event processor.

To work around this problem, edit the BrokerWorkstation.properties file as follows:

on the master domain manager:


     Broker.Workstation.evtproc.wa-server=<wa_server_name>

on the backup domain manager:

     Broker.Workstation.evtproc.wa-server-bkm=<wa_server_bkm_name>

  where

	<wa_server_name> is the hostname of the master domain manager

	<wa_server_bkm_name> is the hostname of the backup domain manager

This limitation applies to only to the stand-alone Docker environment.

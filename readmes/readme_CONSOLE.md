# Workload Automation Console

## Introduction
Workload Automation is a complete, modern solution for batch and real-time workload management. It enables organizations to gain complete visibility and control over attended or unattended workloads. 

From a single point of control, it supports multiple platforms and provides advanced integration with enterprise applications including ERP, Business Analytics, File Transfer, Big Data, and Cloud applications. See [Installing Automation Hub integrations](installing-automation-hub-integrations) for more information about integrating third-party plug-ins and integrations.


Docker adoption ensures standardization of your workload scheduling environment and provides an easy method to replicate environments quickly in development, build, test, and production environments, speeding up the time it takes to get from build to production significantly. Install your environment using Docker to improve scalability, portability, and efficiency.

## Accessing the container images

### From the Entitled Registry
You can access the Console container image from the Entitled Registry:

1. Access the entitled registry. Log in to [MyIBM Container Software Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) with the IBMid and password that are associated with the entitled software.


2.  In the **Container software library** tile, click **View library** and then click **Copy key** to copy the entitlement key to the clipboard.

3.  Run the following command to login into the IBM Entitled Registry:
      
        docker login -u cp -p <your_entitled_key> cp.icr.io
	

 The image is as follows:

* cp.icr.io/cp/ibm-workload-automation-console:10.1.0.00.20220722


### From IBM Fix Central

If you are accessing the images from IBM Fix Central, use the following command to upload the image to your local Docker environment:

     docker load -i <tar_name>
	 
  where <tar_name> is the name of the .tar file containing the image.




Before you deploy IBM Workload Automation components on Linux on Z, see  [Deploying Docker compose on Linux on Z](https://www.ibm.com/docs/workload-scheduler/10.1.0?topic=SSGSPN_10.1.0/compose-deploying-docker-linux-z)




## Getting Started
You can deploy the IBM Workload Automation containers using either Docker compose or Docker run. For both of these methods, ensure you download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com). 

### Getting started with Docker compose

Download and install [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). We recommend version 1.27 or later to take advantage of named volumes.

To start the container via Docker Compose, run the following command to clone the current repository:



         git clone https://github.com/WorkloadAutomation/ibm-workload-automation-docker-compose.git



If you do not have GitHub installed in your environment, download the ZIP file from the main page of the repository:

    Click on "Code" and select "Download ZIP"

If you want customize the installation parameters, modify the **docker-compose.yml** file.

Accept the product licenses by setting the **LICENSE** parameter to **"accept"** in the **wa.env** file located in the container package as follows: **LICENSE=accept**

In the directory where  the **docker-compose.yml** file has been located, you can start the containers by running the following command:

    docker-compose up -d wa-console wa-db2

Once the command has been launched, be sure that the containers are started using the following command:

    docker ps 

You can optionally check the container logs using the following commands:

    docker-compose logs -f wa-console
     OR
    docker-compose logs -f wa-db2


### Getting Started with Docker run

The IBM Workload Automation container has the following prerequisites:

 - Create a DB instance and schema

   For example, use the following command to create a DB2 instance and schema:   

       docker run --rm ibm-workload-automation-console:10.1.0.00 cat /opt/dwc/tools/create_database.sql > create_database.sql
       
   Copy the "create_database.sql" file on the workstation where the DB2 has been installed, perform a login as administrator and run the following command:
 
       db2 -tvf create_database.sql 
       
To start the container from the command-line, launch the following command by adding the name of the image that has been loaded:

	 docker run \
		-d -e LICENSE=ACCEPT \
		-e WA_PASSWORD=wa_password \
		-e DB_TYPE=db_type \
		-e DB_HOSTNAME=db_hostname \
		-e DB_PORT=db_port \
		-e DB_NAME=db_name \
		-e DB_USER=db_user \
		-e DB_PASSWORD=db_password \
		-e DB_ADMIN_USER=db_admin_user \
		-e DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=db_admin_password \
		-v workload-automation-console-data:/home/wauser \
		ibm-workload-automation-console:10.1.0.00.\<release_date>

> **Note:** The name of the image has to be the same as the one you loaded on your local workstation when you launched the docker load command.



> **Note**: Internal ports are predefined and must not be changed. External ports can be customized.

### Installing with custom .PEM certificates
To use custom certificates, modify the volume `<path_on_host_containing_certs>:/opt/wautils/certs` with the path of the directory that contains your certificates at the place of `<path_on_host_containing_certs>`. In the defined folder, add the following certificates:

      - ca.crt
      - tls.key
      - tls.crt

## Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration

To enable SSO between console and server, LTPA tokens must be the same. The following procedure explains how to create LTPA tokens to be shared between server and console (this procedure must be run only once and not on both systems). 

To create new LTPA token, issue the following command:

     docker run -i --rm -v <host_dir>:/output ibm-workload-automation-console:10.1.0.00 /opt/wautils/wa_create_ltpa_keys.sh -p <keys_password>

  where:
  - **<host_dir>** is an existing folder on the local machine where docker runs
  - **<keys_password>** is LTPA keys password ( for further details, see the [online](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGSPN_10.1.0/com.ibm.tivoli.itws.doc_9.5/distr/src_ad/awsadshareltpa.htm) documentation).
	
The "ltpa.keys" and "wa_ltpa.xml" files are created in the local folder \<hostdir>.

The "ltpa.keys" file must be placed into the volume that stores customized SSL certificates (on both server and console charts).

In both server and console charts, useCustomizedCert property must be set on "true".

The "wa_ltpa.xml" file must be placed in the volume that stores all custom liberty configuration (on both server and console charts).

## Installing Automation Hub integrations  

You can extend Workload Automation with a number of out-of-the-box integrations, or plug-ins. Complete documentation for the integrations is available on [Automation Hub](https://www.yourautomationhub.io/). Use this procedure to integrate only the integrations you need to automate your business workflows.

You can also extend Workload Automation with custom plug-ins or integrations that you create. For information about creating a custom plug-in and deploying the plug-in see [Workload Automation Lutist Development Kit](https://www.yourautomationhub.io/toolkit) on Automation Hub.

**Note:** You must perform this procedure before deploying the product components. Any changes made post-installation are applied the next time you perform an upgrade.

By default, your HCL Workload Automation deployment includes a number of integrations that are ready to be used after you deploy the server and console containers. The integrations available are defined in a **.properties** file. Create and customize the **.properties** file that pertains to your environment to exclude any integrations you do not need.

To exclude an integration, follow these steps:

1. Depending on your environment, whether it is a distributed environment or a z/OS environment, create a **.properties** file named **plugins.properties** in the same directory where the docker-compose file resides with the following content:

2) Delete the lines related to the integrations you do not want to make available in your environment. The remaining integrations will be integrated into Workload Automation at deployment time. Save your changes to the file.

   You can always refer back to this readme file and add an integration back into the file in the future. The integration becomes available the next time you update the console and server containers.

5) In the docker-compose.yml file, add the following entry under the volume section of the wa-console component so that it appears as follows:

		volumes:
		- wa-console-data:/home/wauser/
		- ./plugins.properties:/opt/wautils/config/plugins.properties
	
6) In the volumes section at the end of the file, add an additional line with "plugins.properties:" so that the section appears as follows:

		volumes:
		 wa-db2inst1_home:
		 wa-server-data:
		 wa-console-data:
		 wa-agent-data:
		 plugins.properties:

7) Save the changes to the docker-composer.yml file.

Proceed to deploy the product components. After the deployment, you can include jobs related to these integrations when defining your workload.	

## Metrics Monitoring

Workload Automation exposes a number of metrics to provide you with insight into the state, health, and performance of your environment and infrastructure. You can access the product APIs for monitoring and retrieving insightful metrics data. The metrics are exposed and can be visualized with tools for displaying application metrics such as, the open source tool Grafana. If you use Grafana, you can take advantage of the preconfigured dashboard that is available with the deployment of the Dynamic Workload Console and the server  components. For more information about the metrics available, see [Metrics monitoring](https://www.ibm.com/docs/workload-scheduler/10.1.0?topic=reference-monitoring-prometheus). In a Docker environment, by default, access to the metrics does not require authentication. However, if you want to specify a different user that can access the metrics securely using credentials, modify the prometheus.xml file that you will find automatically created in a Docker environment, adding the additional users.
